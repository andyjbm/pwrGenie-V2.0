# Welcome to pwrGenie V2.0
This will soon be full of useful info on how this all works.

Honest...

It is currently a WORK IN PROGRESS. There are no guarantees (and probably never will be).
You are welcome to use at your own risk etc.

For now there's some pretty pics in the pics folder and some example firmwares in the releases folder.

Important Notes so far:
    ESP32-s2-mini needs espressif32 v6.3.2 this is now hard referenced in platformio.ini until its fixed.
    Version 6.5.0 bricks the s2-mini and requires putting into bootloader manually and flashing with working version to get out of the brick.

    I compiled ESP8266 with espressif8266 v3.30102.0. I have not tested the latest V4.2.1 at time of writing.
    This is NOT yet hard referenced in platformio.ini yet but if you are not seeing anything try V3.3.0
